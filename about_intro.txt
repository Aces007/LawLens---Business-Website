I'm Ace, aged 21, and I am still a kid figuring stuff out in an adult body.
I'll admit its not easy trying to venture out as someone who had a dream before and has lost in touch with that person recently.
But I'm here and I am constantly pushing myself to learn as much things as I can so I can rise up from my rock bottom. 
It's taking time, but I've found a calling recently, and I'd like to keep at it if it's going to remove me from bed and improve myself.

Like I said it's taking time and I'm not arguing. I tend to enjoy every moment as possible because I expect that it's gonna be bumpy but
fulfilling at the same time. Welcome to my space! Hope you have a good day and keep fighting the good fight.
